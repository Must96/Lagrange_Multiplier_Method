This project implements Lagrange Mutiplier method for solving a general non-linear optimisation problem in Matlab.  The code developed also verifies the solution of the non-linear programming problem, by employing the Hessian Matrix method.

The code was implemented using a licensed version of R2012b Matlab software.

A detailed explanation about how the code can be executed, the inputs required along with their formats and the explanation about the output obtained has been provided in the Mathematical Programming Project-Read -me.docx file.
